**ZSLang is being rebuilt from scratch.**  
All previous language features, syntax, and documentation are deprecated until the new ZSLang is implemented.

## ⚠️ Status

- The ZSLang interpreter and all related files have been cleared for a full redesign and rewrite.
- All previous documentation, examples, and features are out of date.
- Please do not rely on any ZSLang features until the new engine is complete.

## Next Steps

- Design and implement a new ZSLang interpreter and language core.
- Update this README with new syntax, features, and examples as development progresses.

**Stay tuned for the next generation of ZSLang!**
