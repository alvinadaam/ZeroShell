## Current Status

- ZSL language, CLI, VFS, graphics, and ZSL Studio IDE are all working and integrated.
- Libraries for math, graphics, and games are available and importable.
- The system is modular, extensible, and ready for advanced scripting and learning.
- Project is now hosted on GitHub and ready for open-source collaboration.

---

## ðŸ‘‹ Discussion & Collaboration

- All core features are stable and modular.
- Graphics/GFXLib output is fully integrated and styled.
- ZSL interpreter is refactored and maintainable.
- **We are now ready to start implementing:**
  - Async/background jobs
  - Events and hooks
  - Custom command system
  - Compilation mode
  - More data structures (maps, sets, etc.)
  - More frameworks (UI, networking, etc.)

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Recent Results

- Project structure and documentation are GitHub-ready.
- All code is modular and prepared for new advanced features.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Begin implementing advanced features:**
   - Async/background jobs
   - Events and hooks
   - Custom command system
   - Compilation mode
   - More data structures (maps, sets, etc.)
   - More frameworks (UI, networking, etc.)

2. **Continue improving documentation and onboarding for contributors.**

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Now that ZSLang's README and implementation are in sync and all core/advanced features are documented:

1. **Implement Next Advanced Features:**
   - Custom command system (define your own shell commands in ZSL)
   - Compilation mode (run interactively or compile scripts for speed/distribution)
   - More data structures (maps, sets, etc.)
   - More frameworks (UI, networking, etc.)

2. **Polish and expand:**
   - Improve error handling and diagnostics in ZSL.
   - Expand built-in libraries and frameworks.
   - Add more examples and documentation.

3. **Community & Collaboration:**
   - Encourage contributions, feedback, and new ideas via GitHub.
   - Keep documentation and status up to date as features are added.

## ðŸ’¬ Custom Command System Discussion

We are now planning the **Custom Command System** for ZSLang.  
Let's finalize the design and features before coding.

### Finalized Design & Ideas

- **Scope:**  
  - Users can define new shell commands in ZSL that are available globally (persisted in the VFS as `.zscmd` or similar).
  - Custom commands are managed via the VFS and can be loaded, edited, or deleted like any other file.
  - Aliases and command chaining can be implemented via ZSL scripts or a dedicated aliases library.

- **Syntax:**  
  - Use a clear, shell-like syntax for defining commands:
    ```
    command greet [name]
      print "Hello, " + name
    end
    ```
    - `command <name> [args...] ... end` is easy to read and parse.
    - Arguments are optional and accessible as variables inside the command body.

- **Features:**  
  - Custom commands support arguments, piping, and chaining just like built-in commands.
  - Commands can call other commands or ZSL code.
  - Commands interact with the VFS and environment via built-in ZSL libraries (e.g. `vfs.read`, `vfs.write`).
  - Commands are hot-reloadable: editing or saving a `.zscmd` file updates the command instantly.
  - Command conflicts: user-defined commands override built-ins only if explicitly allowed (with a warning or prompt).
  - Listing/documentation:
    - `help --u` lists user-defined commands.
    - `help --s` lists system/built-in commands.
    - Each command can have a docstring or comment at the top for help output.

- **Extensibility:**  
  - The system is modular: new command types, argument parsing, or advanced features can be added via libraries in the `engine/` folder.
  - Aliases, macros, and advanced chaining can be implemented as ZSL libraries.

---

**Action:**  
- This design will be documented in the ZSLang README and implemented in the next step.
- If you have more refinements or want to prioritize a specific aspect, let me know!

---

- The status.md file accurately tracks project progress, current state, and next steps.
- It is ready for GitHub project management and team collaboration.
- You can update this file as you work on new features or want to communicate status.

## ðŸš€ Custom Command System: Implementation Complete

- Users can now define their own shell commands in ZSL using the `command <name> [args...] ... end` syntax.
- Custom commands are stored as `.zscmd` files in `/zslang/cmds` in the VFS.
- Commands are hot-reloadable: editing or saving a `.zscmd` file updates the command instantly.
- Custom commands support arguments, piping, chaining, and can call other commands or ZSL code.
- Listing and documentation:
  - `help --u` will list user-defined commands (to be implemented in help).
  - Each command can have a docstring or comment at the top for help output.
- The system is modular and ready for further extension (aliases, macros, etc).

---

**Action:**  
- Test the custom command system by creating `.zscmd` files in `/zslang/cmds`.
- Refine or request features as needed.
- Next: add built-in system commands, polish help, and expand documentation.
