# ZeroShell Project Status & Feedback

---

## ⚠️ ZSLang Rebuild In Progress

- The ZSLang interpreter and all related code have been removed.
- We are starting a complete redesign and rebuild of the ZSLang language and engine.
- All previous ZSLang features, tests, and documentation are now obsolete.
- ZeroShell core (CLI, VFS, IDE, etc.) remains functional and ready for integration with the new ZSLang.

---

## Next Steps

- Design and implement a new ZSLang interpreter from scratch.
- Update documentation and tests as the new language takes shape.
- Collaborate on language design, syntax, and features before coding.

**If you have ideas for the new ZSLang, add them here or in a new design doc.**
