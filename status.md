# ZeroShell Project Status & Feedback

---

## üöÄ ZSLang Minimal Print Working

- The new ZSLang engine is scaffolded and integrated.
- `print` statements now output correctly to the ZeroShell terminal.
- You can now incrementally add and test new language features (variables, math, control flow, etc.).
- The core website and CLI are stable and ready for further ZSLang development.

---

## üí° ZSLang Code Organization Note

- As ZSLang grows, logic will be split across multiple files for maintainability.
- `interpreter.js` currently handles the main loop and statement dispatch.
- Parsing/tokenizing is in `parser.js`.
- Future:  
  - Expression evaluation, variable scope, and assignment logic can move to `runtime.js` or `env.js`.
  - Math, string, and array helpers will go in `stdlib/`.
  - Control flow, error handling, and advanced features will be modularized.
- This modular approach will keep ZSLang organized and scalable as features are added.

---

## ‚úÖ ZSLang: Print & Variables Working

- Print statements and variable assignment are fully working and tested.
- All related manual tests have passed.
- The test suite is now focused on math and expressions as the next feature.

---

## üö¶ ZSLang: Math, Arrays, and Input Added

- Math expressions (+, -, *, /, %) are now supported in assignments and print.
- Array literals and access (arr[0]) are supported.
- Input statements use the ZeroShell input modal if available.
- Standard library for math and arrays is scaffolded.
- Next: control flow, functions, imports, and more advanced features.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è ZSLang: Input Modal Integration & Next Steps

- Input statements now use the ZeroShell input modal (inline in terminal) for a consistent UX.
- Math, variables, and arrays are working for basic cases.
- Next: focus on building ZSLang libraries inside the VFS and expanding stdlib.
- After that, implement control flow, functions, and imports.

---

## üü¢ ZSLang: Math Parentheses & Array Methods Fixed

- Parentheses in math expressions now work correctly.
- Array length, push, and pop methods are supported and output as expected.
- All current manual tests pass except for unimplemented features (control flow, functions, imports).
- ZSLang codebase and stdlib are organized and ready for further development.

---

## üü¢ ZSLang: All Current Core Features Working

- All core ZSLang features (print, variables, math, arrays, input, control flow, functions) are working and pass all manual tests.
- Input modal is styled and integrated with the terminal.
- Array methods and math expressions (including parentheses) work as expected.
- Codebase is modular and organized for further expansion.

---

## üöÄ Next Focus: Imports & Stdlib

- Next step: implement `import` and support for `.zs` library files in the VFS.
- Plan:  
  - Allow users to create `.zs` files (e.g. `mathlib.zs`, `stringlib.zs`) in the VFS.
  - Support `import mathlib` in scripts to load and use functions/variables from those files.
  - This will make it easy to extend ZSLang with user and system libraries.

---

**Discussion:**  
- Building libraries as `.zs` files in the VFS is a flexible and user-friendly approach.
- It allows anyone to add or update libraries without changing the engine.
- Recommend: Start with this approach for math, string, and utility libs.
- Later, you can add built-in JS stdlib modules for performance or special features if needed.

---

## üü¢ ZSLang: Ready for Imports & VFS Libraries

- All core features are working and tested.
- You do **not** need to delete existing `.zs` library files in `scripts/zslang/` (like `mathlib.zs`, `gfxlib.zs`, `gamelib.zs`).
- The new ZSLang import system will simply read and use these files from the VFS.
- If you want to update or improve a library, just edit the `.zs` file in place.
- If you want to add a new library, just create a new `.zs` file in the VFS.

---

**Action:**  
- You can safely keep, edit, or add `.zs` files in `scripts/zslang/` for libraries.
- The import system will use whatever is present in the VFS.
- No need to delete unless you want a clean slate.

---

## üü¢ ZSLang: Imports & VFS Libraries Working

- ZSLang now supports `import` for `.zs` library files in the VFS.
- You can create, edit, or remove `.zs` libraries in `scripts/zslang/` as needed.
- **If you add a `.zs` file to `scripts/zslang/`, it will appear in the VFS and can be imported in your scripts automatically.**
- The import system loads and executes library code into the current script's scope.
- No need to delete or reset library files; just update or add as needed.

---

**Action:**  
- Test `import` with sample libraries (e.g. mathlib.zs, gfxlib.zs).
- Expand and document library usage as you go.

---

## üü¢ ZSLang: Fresh, Efficient VFS Libraries

- All old libraries in `scripts/zslang/` have been deleted.
- Fresh, efficient `.zs` libraries (mathlib, stringlib, arraylib, gfxlib) are created and cover essential features.
- Libraries are easy to extend and optimized for ZSLang usage.
- README updated to reflect new library structure and usage.

---

**Action:**  
- Test new libraries and their functions.
- Expand or improve libraries as needed.
- Next: error handling, diagnostics, and integration with CLI/VFS/graphics.
