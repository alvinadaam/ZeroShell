# ZeroShell Project Status & Feedback

## Current Status

- ZSL language, CLI, VFS, graphics, and ZSL Studio IDE are all working and integrated.
- Libraries for math, graphics, and games are available and importable.
- The system is modular, extensible, and ready for advanced scripting and learning.

---

## ðŸ‘‹ Discussion & Collaboration

- Input system (modal/inline) is smooth and works well for CLI and ZSL scripts.
- ZSL Studio IDE works, but needs more UX/UI improvements.
- File system and permissions are smooth; tab completion and command autocomplete could be improved.
- Graphics/GFXLib output is fully integrated and styled.
- Error handling in ZSL is minimal; most errors are ignored or print 0.
- **The ZSL interpreter/compiler is now refactored into modular files under `zslang/engine/` for maintainability and future features.**

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Recent Results

- All core features (input, CLI, IDE, VFS, graphics, library import) are working and unified.
- Graphics output and GFXLib wrappers display as expected.
- Interpreter is modular, maintainable, and matches the features described in `zslang/README.md`.

---

## âœ… Status: ZSLang matches README.md

- The ZSL language, as described in `zslang/README.md`, is implemented and working as specified.
- All described features (variables, functions, imports, graphics, native commands, etc.) are present.
- You can now update or expand the README as needed, and safely move to the next steps (async/background jobs, events/hooks, IDE/UX, etc.).

---

**Action:**  
- You are clear to update `zslang/README.md` as you wish.
- Next steps: continue with async/background jobs, events/hooks, and further language/IDE improvements.
